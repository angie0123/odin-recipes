    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Angel Food Cake:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup cake flour</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>15 large egg whites, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, sifted 3 times</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Frosting:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups powdered sugar</li>
      <li>2 sticks salted butter, softened</li>
      <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>Yellow food coloring</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>For the angel food cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
      <li>
        Combine the cake flour and salt in a medium bowl and sift together 5
        times. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, with an electric mixer fitted with the whisk
        attachment, beat the egg whites until frothy (lots of bubbles but still
        liquid and loose). Add the cream of tartar and beat on high until stiff,
        4 to 5 minutes. With the mixer on medium low, slowly sprinkle in the
        sifted granulated sugar. Fold in the sifted flour mixture gently until
        it's all combined. Sprinkle the vanilla into the bowl and fold gently.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon the batter into an angel food or tube pan (preferably with cooling
        legs)--make sure there's no grease or butter in there! Smooth the top
        and bake until a wooden skewer stuck all the way to the bottom comes out
        clean, 35 to 45 minutes. (Don't open the oven while it's baking!)
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully remove the cake from the oven and immediately invert it onto
        its cooling legs (see Cook's Note). Let the cake cool completely while
        upside-down.
      </li>
      <li>
        For the frosting: Beat the powdered sugar, butter and cream in a large
        bowl with an electric mixer until very light and fluffy. Add a few drops
        of yellow food coloring as desired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully remove the cake from the pan and transfer it to a cake plate
        upside-down, so that the end that was stuck to the bottom of the pan is
        now facing up. Frost the cake all over.
      </li>
    </ol>
