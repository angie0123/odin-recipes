        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
          Imagine warm, sticky toffee running over a delightfully delicate and
          moist banana cake. This warm, timeless dessert is a take on the
          English sticky toffee pudding. A crowd pleaser to be sure, for kids
          and adults alike.

          This is a great recipe for cleaning out your overly ripe bananas. The
          more brown spots, the better. I love it when I find these suckers -
          that means its time to make some cake!

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Banana Cake:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            1 3/4 cups all purpose flour, spooned into measuring cup and
            leveled-off with a knife
          </li>
          <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled</li>
          <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
          <li>2 large eggs</li>
          <li>1 cup very ripe mashed bananas, from 2-3 spotty bananas</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
          <li>1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Toffee Sauce:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>1 1/4 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
          <li>1/2 cup dark brown sugar</li>
          <li>1/2 cup light corn syrup</li>
          <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
          <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Butter and flour an 8x8-inch baking dish.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking
            powder and salt.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the bowl of an electric mixer, mix the melted butter and sugar
            until blended. Add the eggs, mashed bananas, lemon juice and vanilla
            extract and mix well.
          </li>
          <li>
            On low speed, stir in the flour mixture until just incorporated. Do
            not over mix. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until
            golden, and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, about
            35 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, make the sauce. Bring the heavy cream, brown sugar, corn
            syrup, butter, and salt to a boil in a heavy small saucepan over
            high heat, whisking until the sugar dissolves. Reduce the heat to
            medium-low and cook at a gentle boil, whisking occasionally, until
            the sauce is slightly thickened, about 15 minutes. It should be the
            consistency of maple syrup -- it will continue to thicken as it
            cools. Remove the sauce from the heat and cool.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spoon 1/3 cup of the toffee sauce over top of the baked banana cake.
            Return the cake to the oven and bake until the sauce is bubbling
            vigorously, about 6 minutes. Cool the cake in the pan on a rack for
            at least 30 minutes. Cut the cake into 9 squares or 12 rectangles.
            Serve the cake slightly warm or at room temperature with warm toffee
            sauce and top with sliced bananas and pecans, if desired.
